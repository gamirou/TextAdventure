# __TextAdventure__
### A text-based Maze Adventure game

# Not finished
#### So, if you want to help me design new levels, clone this repo into your computer

#### The levels were designed in __http://www.delorie.com/game-room/mazes/genmaze.cgi__

## Options
* Number of cells across (1..N): _40_
* Number of cells up/down (1..N): _20_
* Type of maze: _ASCII_
* Width of each cell (2..N): _2_
* Height of each cell (2..N): _2_
* Random Number Seed (optional): _NONE_

It is a rather boring game, as it is text-based, but I will make a pygame version of it.

What to do:
- [ ] add 10 levels
- [ ] add more special items


_Waiting for your suggestions_
